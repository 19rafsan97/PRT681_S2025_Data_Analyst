 Week 5 –
This week focused on deepening my knowledge of Microsoft SQL Server tools, 
completing training on SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS), and exploring 
SSMS concepts related to OLAP cubes and dimensions. I also designed and 
tested a small ETL pipeline and studied star schema modeling.



1. LinkedIn Learning – SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)

- Completed the LinkedIn Learning course on SSIS.
- Learned the difference between Control Flow and Data Flow.
- Practiced creating and using Connection Managers (Flat File, OLE DB).
- Implemented a simple ETL pipeline:
  Flat File Source → Derived Column (audit fields) → OLE DB Destination (FastLoad).
- Learned to add audit fields:
  * LoadBatchId = NEWID()
  * LoadDts = SYSUTCDATETIME()
  * SourceFile = parameter from the flat file name
- Understood Lookup, Merge Join, and error redirection patterns in SSIS.
- Noted the importance of using Fast Load with Table Lock for bulk insert performance.



2. ETL Pipeline Demo (SQL + CSV Source)
- Created a staging table: stg.Sales_Staging
- Designed audit fields to track file loads (SourceFile, LoadBatchId, LoadDts).
- Prepared a sample CSV file (etl_source_sales.csv) with demo sales orders.
- Loaded data into staging and then merged into dbo.FactSales using a T-SQL MERGE statement.
- Documented the ETL design, mappings, and error handling steps.




3. OLAP Concepts – Cubes & Dimensions

- Explored SSMS basics related to OLAP cubes and dimensions.
- Learned how a Star Schema is structured:
  * Fact table: contains numeric measures (e.g., sales).
  * Dimension tables: contain descriptive attributes (Customer, Product, Time).
- Created a demo star schema in SQL Server:
  * DimCustomer, DimProduct, DimDate, FactSales
- Inserted sample records and ran queries for analysis:
  * Revenue by Category
  * Sales by Customer City
- Documented MDX example queries for cube-like analysis.

4. Learning Logs & Evidence

- Created structured logs of resources studied during the week.
- YouTube / LinkedIn resources included:
  * TechBrothersIT SSIS Tutorial for Beginners playlist
  * Guy in a Cube – Star Schema vs Snowflake
  * SQLBI – Intro to SSAS Tabular Models
- Logged dates, topics, durations, and notes into CSV, Markdown, and PDF.
