#Week 4 â€“ Microsoft SQL Tools, JOIN Practice & CSV Import

The focus this week was on **exploring Microsoft SQL tools (SSMS/SSIS)**, practicing **JOIN queries**, and **importing a CSV dataset** into SQL Server using the **SSMS Import Wizard**.  
All work is supported with datasets, SQL scripts, notes, and reports as evidence.


## Activities Completed

1. **Explored Microsoft SQL Tools**
   - Installed and explored **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** and **SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS)**.
   - Learned the basics of Object Explorer, Query Editor, and Import Wizard.
   - Understood the difference between Control Flow and Data Flow in SSIS.

2. **LinkedIn Learning Training**
   - Followed courses on **SSMS and SSIS basics**.
   - Practiced **INNER JOIN** and **LEFT JOIN** queries with example datasets.
   - Learned how to use **GROUP BY** and aggregation functions (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) for reporting.

3. **CSV Import into SQL Server**
   - Used the **SSMS Import Flat File Wizard** to import `sales_data.csv` into a new table `dbo.ImportedSales`.
   - Validated the data load with SQL queries to check row counts, sample data, and aggregated values.
   - Normalized the imported data into `Customers`, `Products`, and `Orders` tables.
   - Wrote JOIN queries to combine data across these tables and generate insights (e.g., revenue by product, last order date per customer).
