# Week 3 â€“ SQL DML, SQLite Training & LeetCode Practice

This folder documents all the work I completed during week3 
The focus was on **SQL DML operations**, **SQLite practice**, and **problem-solving** using LeetCode SQL challenges.  
Additionally, I followed structured tutorials and YouTube learning resources to strengthen my database skills.

## Activities Completed

1. **Practiced Sample Database + DML Operations**
   - Created sample tables (`Students`, `Customers`, `Orders`).
   - Inserted test records using `INSERT`.
   - Updated records (e.g., grade updates, increasing order amounts).
   - Deleted rows (e.g., removing specific orders or students).
   - Queried results with `SELECT` to verify changes.
   - Exported results into CSV files as evidence.

2. **Continued SQLite Training**
   - Learned about **transactions** (`BEGIN`, `COMMIT`, `ROLLBACK`).
   - Reviewed **constraints**: `PRIMARY KEY`, `FOREIGN KEY`, `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`.
   - Practiced **joins** (`INNER JOIN`, `LEFT JOIN`) for customer spending summaries.
   - Applied **aggregate functions** (`SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`) with `GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.
   - Wrote queries to analyze total spending per customer.

3. **Solved SQL Queries on LeetCode**
   - Attempted common SQL interview-style problems:
     - Combine Two Tables
     - Employees Earning More Than Their Managers
     - Customers Who Never Order
     - Duplicate Emails
     - Rising Temperature
     - Department Top Three Salaries (window functions)
   - Saved reference solutions in `leetcode-sql-solutions.sql`.

4. **Watched YouTube Tutorials for SQL & SQLite**
   - Followed well-known tutorials to strengthen concepts:
